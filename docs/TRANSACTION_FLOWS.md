# Transaction Flows

This document describes how different transaction types affect balances in the NVLP system.

## Income Transaction Flow

Income transactions represent money entering the budget system. They automatically increase the budget's `available_amount`.

### How It Works

1. **Transaction Creation**: When a transaction with `transaction_type = 'income'` is created:
   - Must include `income_source_id` (required)
   - Must NOT include envelope or payee references
   - Amount must be positive

2. **Automatic Balance Update**: Database trigger `update_budget_available()` automatically:
   - Increases `budgets.available_amount` by the transaction amount
   - This happens instantly upon transaction insert

3. **Soft Delete Handling**: If an income transaction is soft deleted:
   - The trigger reverses the balance change
   - `available_amount` decreases by the transaction amount
   - Restoring the transaction re-applies the income

### Example Flow

```typescript
// 1. Initial state
budget.available_amount = 100.00

// 2. Create income transaction
transaction = {
  transaction_type: 'income',
  amount: 500.00,
  income_source_id: 'salary-source-id',
  transaction_date: '2025-01-29',
  description: 'Monthly salary'
}

// 3. After insert (automatic via trigger)
budget.available_amount = 600.00  // 100 + 500

// 4. If soft deleted
transaction.is_deleted = true
budget.available_amount = 100.00  // Reverted to original

// 5. If restored
transaction.is_deleted = false
budget.available_amount = 600.00  // Re-applied
```

### Database Implementation

The income flow is implemented via PostgreSQL trigger:

```sql
-- From update_budget_available() function
IF NEW.transaction_type = 'income' THEN
  UPDATE public.budgets 
  SET available_amount = available_amount + NEW.amount
  WHERE id = NEW.budget_id;
END IF;
```

### Testing

Run the test script to verify income transaction flow:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/test-income-transaction.ts
```

## Allocation Transaction Flow

Allocation transactions move money from the budget's available pool to specific envelopes. This is how you "allocate" or "budget" your available money into spending categories.

### How It Works

1. **Transaction Creation**: When a transaction with `transaction_type = 'allocation'` is created:
   - Must include `to_envelope_id` (required)
   - Must NOT include envelope or payee references
   - Amount must be positive
   - Budget must have sufficient available funds

2. **Automatic Balance Updates**: Database triggers automatically:
   - **Decrease** `budgets.available_amount` by the transaction amount
   - **Increase** `envelopes.current_balance` by the transaction amount
   - This happens instantly upon transaction insert

3. **Soft Delete Handling**: If an allocation transaction is soft deleted:
   - The triggers reverse the balance changes
   - `available_amount` increases by the transaction amount
   - `envelope.current_balance` decreases by the transaction amount
   - Restoring the transaction re-applies the allocation

### Example Flow

```typescript
// 1. Initial state (after income)
budget.available_amount = 1000.00
envelope.current_balance = 0.00

// 2. Create allocation transaction
transaction = {
  transaction_type: 'allocation',
  amount: 300.00,
  to_envelope_id: 'groceries-envelope-id',
  transaction_date: '2025-01-29',
  description: 'Allocate to groceries'
}

// 3. After insert (automatic via triggers)
budget.available_amount = 700.00   // 1000 - 300
envelope.current_balance = 300.00  // 0 + 300

// 4. If soft deleted
transaction.is_deleted = true
budget.available_amount = 1000.00  // Reverted
envelope.current_balance = 0.00    // Reverted

// 5. If restored
transaction.is_deleted = false
budget.available_amount = 700.00   // Re-applied
envelope.current_balance = 300.00  // Re-applied
```

### Database Implementation

The allocation flow is implemented via PostgreSQL triggers:

```sql
-- Budget trigger (update_budget_available)
ELSIF NEW.transaction_type = 'allocation' THEN
  UPDATE public.budgets 
  SET available_amount = available_amount - NEW.amount
  WHERE id = NEW.budget_id;

-- Envelope trigger (update_envelope_balance)  
IF NEW.to_envelope_id IS NOT NULL THEN
  UPDATE public.envelopes 
  SET current_balance = current_balance + NEW.amount
  WHERE id = NEW.to_envelope_id;
```

### Money Flow Summary

**Available Pool â†’ Envelope**
- Available money decreases by allocation amount
- Envelope balance increases by allocation amount
- Zero-sum: total money in system remains constant

## Expense Transaction Flow

*To be implemented in next phase*

Expense transactions move money from envelopes to payees (money leaves the system).

## Transfer Transaction Flow

*To be implemented in next phase*

Transfer transactions move money between envelopes within the same budget.

## Debt Payment Transaction Flow

*To be implemented in next phase*

Debt payment transactions are similar to expenses but tracked separately for reporting.
